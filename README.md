app to play liar's cards online

#bugs
going to '/game-room' works if you don't have a proper token
needs to show who's turn it is for each turn so people who can't do anything know who can
should also show how many cards each person has
if someone is out for a round, they should not have the "show cards" options (it should auto show them cards when everyone who is still playing is ready)
if someone has already been out (or maybe as soon as they are out), they shouldn't have the option to ready up anymore (it should always show them as ready)

show on screen to a player when they are out or they win

#stretch
someone should be able to x out/ refresh and still play the game they were in properly
show how many of each suit there was at the end of the round in the moves(rename to 'data' or something) box
have card count persist to database?
